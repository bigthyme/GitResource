##How to Git

This is the official git repository for the training session we had for Git/GitHub. In it, there is a full pdf document that has all the slides covered through our training, as well as a "Cheat Sheet" document for your own personal reference. If you see a mistake in the document, feel free to make an issue in the repo, make a branch and commit your "fix/enhancement". 

Thanks all and enjoy using Git!
